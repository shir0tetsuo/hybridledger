# HybridLedger

# Description
HybridLedger uses grid positions to hold "minted" immutable data blocks, 
which generates individual value over time. 
Each grid position is a "Hybrid Ledger" (like a Blockchain Wallet), 
it holds a stack of minted value as well as a data point. They'll be 
referred to as **HL**'s.

Using timestamps, it's possible to "see back in time" to observe other 
**HL** near the time of minting. It's possible to take over other positions 
by minting over them, consuming that **HL** and its value.

There is an "infinite" number of spaces encoded in Hexadecimal.

There are currently no plans to implement a multi-server system.
